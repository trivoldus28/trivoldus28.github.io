Hi! I recently got my PhD from Princeton University. I was advised by Professor [David Wentzlaff](http://www.princeton.edu/~wentzlaf/) in the field of Computer Engineering at the [Princeton Parallel Computing](http://parallel.princeton.edu) research group. I am now a postdoc in the [Lee Lab](https://lee.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School to understand the brain computation at the circuit level.
